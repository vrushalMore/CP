# Izhikevich Spiking Neural Network Simulation

This project simulates the behavior of a spiking neural network using the Izhikevich neuron model, a computationally efficient and biologically plausible model of neuron dynamics. The simulation includes two types of neurons: excitatory (Regular Spiking) and inhibitory (Low-Threshold Spiking), connected through synaptic weights.
